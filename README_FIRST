HOW TO USE GRAV90:
---------------------------------------------------

(1) Read the information files in the GRAV_EXAMPLES 
    directory. I have tried to comment throughout all
    all Fortran90 and IDL codes to facilitate your own
    modifications. 


(2) Copy the Fortran90 routines to the ALASKA and BIGBEAR
    directories. This is because as some files are 
    automatically overwritten, you want to run the code
    in a dedicated directory with the necessary data files.


(3) Compile the Fortran90 routines as ($=the prompt):

$ gfortran -o GRAV_GREEN GRAV_GREEN.f90
$ gfortran -o GRAVITY GRAVITY.f90

Or use the Fortran90 compiler of your choice.


(4) Make sure all the necessary data files are present.
    The user is responsible for creating the following:
	- a fault medium file (See MEDIUM_INFO.d
	  for more information).
	- a fault segment geometry file (See FAULT_SEG_INFO.d
	  for more details). This usually takes the longest
	  to produce for your system of interest.
	- a fault slip-history file (See FAULT_SLP_HIST.d
	  for more information). Example "MAKE_HIST"
	  F77 files are included. The ALASKA one demonstrates
	  how to create a history file for a simple slip history,
	  and the BIGBEAR one shows a more complicated system
	  with multiple slips over several years. 


(5) Enter the directory of the data you wish to examine and execute
    the Fortran90 programs in the following sequence ($=the prompt):
	
	FIRST RUN:

	$ ./GRAV_GREEN <hit return>
	Answer all queries

	THEN RUN:

	$ ./GRAVITY <hit return>
	Answer all queries. 
	

(6) To visualize the data, you can use the IDL files found in the 
    GRAV_IDL directory. You only need to run GRAVITY90_VIEW.pro
    to visualize the data as it calls the rest of the files 
    internally. You run the program as follows ($=the prompt):
	
	$ idl <hit return>
	$ .r GRAVITY90_VIEW.pro <hit return>

	And answer the on-screen queries. 
	
	IMPORTANT: ALL OF THE DATA FILES (except the gravity Green's
		   values) MUST BE PRESENT IN THE DIRECOTRY IN WHICH
		   GRAVITY90_VIEW IS RUN!!!
